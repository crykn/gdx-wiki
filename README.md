# libGDX Wiki
This is a first draft of porting the libGDX Wiki to the [main libGDX website](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io). It can be seen live at: https://crykn.github.io/

## How does it work?
- This repo is basically a fork of https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io
- The wiki files were ported to Jekyll with the help of [some code by Spaio](https://github.com/Spaio/libgdx-wiki-index)
- The website itself is a Jekyll blog that is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions; see `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`
- The blog uses a modified version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme; see `_sass/wiki.scss`; `_layouts/default_wiki.html`, `_layouts/wiki.html`

## ToDo
Help is very much appreciated! If you are interested in picking up one of the tasks below, I'm happy to accept PRs. If you have any questions, just message me on the libGDX Discord.
- [ ] **Improve sidebar layout (!) & responsiveness**; the content of the sidebar can be found in `_includes/wiki_sidebar.md`; it is included in `_layouts/wiki.html` (via `{{ sidebar_include | markdownify }}`) so it can be styled there; any corresponding CSS stuff should be located in `_sass/wiki.scss`
- [ ] **Fix dark mode**; i.e. add a dark style to `_sass/wiki.scss`, utilising `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media queries
- [ ] **Fix external link marker** not appearing; see [here](https://github.com/crykn/crykn.github.io/blob/dev/_plugins/external_links.rb#L51)

## Ideas
- [ ] **Embedding GWT content**, which would allow us to include actual executable libGDX examples directly in the wiki: the JS code should be located somewhere in `/assets/wiki`; then a `<div>` and the corresponding script (see the index.html generated by a libGDX GWT project) needs to be added to the wiki page; the GWT application itself requires some (asset) path changes. Later on, a custom `embed-gwt` element (see [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io/blob/dev/_includes/status.html) for a very basic example of an element) should be created to simplify usage.
