# Prerequisites
Building the natives is slightly more involved. The natives are built for every platform we target:

- Windows (32 and 64 bit), Linux (arm32, arm64, x86_64), macOS (arm64, x86_64)
- Android (armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64)
- iOS (armv7, arm64, x86_64)

To do this we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/actions), which compiles the Windows, Linux and Android natives on a Linux host and the macOS and iOS natives on a mac host. If you are interested in the behind-the-scenes stuff, you should take a look at the [gdx-jnigen project](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-jnigen).

Please note that the information below may be outdated. If you are interested in building libGDX's natives yourself, be sure to check out our actual [build configuration](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-publish.yml) on GitHub.

# Linux host
What you need:

- 64 bit Linux distro (we use Ubuntu 13.10)
- openjdk-7-jdk
- Ant 1.9.3+ (must be on path)
- Maven 3+ (must be on path)
- Android NDK r13b (ANDROID_NDK and NDK_HOME variables set)
- Android SDK with latest targets (ANDROID_SDK variable set)
- Compilers
- gcc, g++, gcc-multilib, g++-multilib, (32 bit and 64 bit Linux compilers)
- mesa-common-dev, libxxf86vm-dev, libxrandr-dev, libx11-dev:i386, jglfw only
- mingw-w64 (Windows compiler 32 bit and 64 bit)
- ccache (optional)
- lib32z1

# macOS host
What you need:

- JDK 8+
- XCode, through Mac app store
- XCode command line utilities for latest XCode
- Ant 1.9.3+ (must be on path, use homebrew)
- ccache (optional, use homebrew)

# Compiling
Compiling the natives is handled through **Ant** scripts.

To compile the macOS and iOS natives, run:

```
./ant -f build-mac-ios.xml
```

To compile the Windows, Linux and Android natives, run:

```
./ant -f build.xml -Dbuild-natives=true -Dversion=nightly
```

You can also run each individual platforms script to build natives for just that platform, for example just the Android natives, just run that particular script itself, (you may have to set some extra command line properties yourself, so check out each script to see what it expects).
